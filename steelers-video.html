<p> Steelers run over the Ravens </p>
In a highly anticipated clash between two fierce AFC North rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers asserted their dominance with a resounding victory over the Baltimore Ravens. The game, marked by its physicality and intensity, showcased the Steelers' exceptional running game, which proved to be the key factor in their commanding win. Let's delve into the highlights of this thrilling matchup that left fans on the edge of their seats.
<br>
<br>

From the opening drive, the Steelers set the tone by establishing a relentless ground assault. Led by their dynamic running back duo, the combination of Najee Harris and Benny Snell Jr. proved to be an unstoppable force against the Ravens' defense. The offensive line's impeccable blocking created lanes for the running backs, allowing them to consistently gain yards and control the tempo of the game.
<br>
<br>
Najee Harris, the rookie sensation, displayed a remarkable blend of power, agility, and vision. His ability to break tackles and turn short gains into explosive plays kept the Ravens' defense on its heels throughout the matchup. Harris's impressive performance not only boosted the Steelers' ground game but also underscored his emergence as a premier running back in the league.

Benny Snell Jr., providing a change of pace, added to the Steelers' ground dominance with his bruising running style. Snell's physicality complemented Harris's finesse, making it challenging for the Ravens to anticipate and counter the Steelers' rushing attack effectively.

Controlled Time of Possession:

One of the critical aspects of the Steelers' success in this matchup was their ability to control the time of possession. By consistently churning out first downs on the ground, the Steelers limited the Ravens' offensive opportunities and kept their defense on the field for extended periods. This strategic approach not only wore down the Ravens' defense but also allowed the Steelers to dictate the pace of the game.
<br>
<br>
Defensive Excellence:
<br>
<br>
While the spotlight shone on the Steelers' offensive prowess, their defense deserves commendation for stifling the Ravens' attempts to counter. The Steelers' defense effectively contained Lamar Jackson, the Ravens' elusive quarterback, limiting his scrambling opportunities and forcing him into uncomfortable passing situations. This defensive effort, combined with the offensive dominance, created a comprehensive team performance that ultimately sealed the Steelers' victory.
